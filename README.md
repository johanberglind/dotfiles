# Dotfiles

Welcome!

These are my dotfiles to quickly setup a dev/work/play enviroment. This includes i3, emacs and much more!

## Install

`curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johanberglind/dotfiles/master/deploy_dotfiles.sh | bash`

I know, I know... Piping shell script from the internet to bash, not very secure! Check the deploy_dotfiles.sh before you do this.

Use at your own risk!
